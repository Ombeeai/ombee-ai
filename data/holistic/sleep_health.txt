Holistic Guide to Sleep Health

Holistic sleep health views sleep not just as "rest" but as a critical active state for brain detoxification, memory consolidation, and cellular repair.

Core Strategies:
- Circadian Alignment: Exposure to natural morning sunlight helps set the body's internal clock (suprachiasmatic nucleus), making it easier to fall asleep at night.
- The "Wind-Down" Routine: Create a buffer zone 60 minutes before bed. Engage in low-stimulation activities like reading, gentle stretching, or journaling to signal the parasympathetic nervous system (rest and digest).
- Environment Optimization: Keep the bedroom cool (60-67°F), dark, and quiet. Limit blue light exposure (screens) which suppresses melatonin production.
- Dietary Timing: Stop caffeine intake by 2 PM and alcohol at least 3 hours before bed. While alcohol may induce sleepiness, it severely disrupts REM sleep and restorative deep sleep cycles.
- Movement: Regular physical activity promotes deeper sleep, but intense exercise should be avoided 4 hours before bedtime to prevent over-stimulation.
