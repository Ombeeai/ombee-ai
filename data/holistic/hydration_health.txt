Hydration Health: Benefits and Guidelines

Water is the foundation of holistic health, essential for digestion, temperature regulation, joint lubrication, and toxin removal.

Daily Requirements (General Guidelines):
- Men: Approx. 15.5 cups (124 oz) of fluids daily.
- Women: Approx. 11.5 cups (92 oz) of fluids daily.
*Note: About 20% of fluid intake typically comes from food (fruits/veggies).*

Signs of Dehydration:
- Fatigue or low energy.
- Dizziness or headache.
- Dark yellow urine (aim for pale straw color).

Holistic Tips for Hydration:
1. Flavor Naturally: Infuse water with cucumber, lemon, mint, or berries to make it more palatable without added sugar.
2. Routine Stacking: Drink a full glass immediately upon waking to rehydrate after sleep, and one glass before every meal.
3. Eat Your Water: Increase consumption of water-rich foods like watermelon, celery, cucumbers, and lettuce.
4. Listen to Thirst: As we age, thirst signals diminish. Set reminders if necessary, especially during activity or hot weather.
