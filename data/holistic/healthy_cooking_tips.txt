Healthy Cooking Techniques for Holistic Nutrition

How you prepare food is just as important as what you eat. Holistic cooking aims to preserve nutrients and avoid adding harmful fats or excessive sodium.

Recommended Methods:
- Steaming: Preserves the most water-soluble vitamins (like Vitamin C and B) compared to boiling. Great for broccoli, carrots, and greens.
- Roasting: Enhances natural sweetness and flavor without needing heavy sauces. Use a rack to let fat drip away from meats.
- Poaching: Gently cooks delicate foods (fish, eggs, fruit) in water or broth, requiring no added fat.
- Stir-Frying: Cooks food quickly at high heat, retaining texture and nutrients. Use healthy oils (avocado, olive) and lots of vegetables.

Ingredient Swaps:
- Flavor: Use fresh herbs, spices, citrus juice (lemon/lime), and vinegar instead of salt or heavy sauces.
- Fats: Replace butter/lard with olive oil, avocado oil, or nut oils.
- Grains: Swap refined white flour/rice for whole grains like quinoa, brown rice, or barley for added fiber.
