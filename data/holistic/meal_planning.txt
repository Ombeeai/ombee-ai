Holistic Meal Planning & Seasonal Eating

Holistic meal planning goes beyond counting calories; it focuses on seasonal rhythms, nutrient density, and reducing food waste to connect us with our environment.

Steps to Seasonal Planning:
1. Inventory First: Before buying, look at what you already have. Use up perishables and pantry staples to minimize waste.
2. Check the Season: Identify what produce is currently being harvested in your region (e.g., root vegetables in winter, greens in spring). Seasonal food is often fresher, cheaper, and more nutrient-dense.
3. The "Theme" Method: Assign themes to days to reduce decision fatigue (e.g., "Stir-Fry Wednesday" using whatever seasonal veggies are available; "Soup Sunday" for batch cooking).
4. Plan for "Life": Include quick meals or leftovers for busy nights to avoid reliance on processed convenience foods.
5. Shop the Perimeter: Focus your grocery run on the outer edges of the store where fresh produce, meats, and dairy are located, minimizing time in the processed food aisles.

Benefits:
- Aligns diet with nature's cycles.
- Reduces stress around "what's for dinner."
- Saves money and supports local agriculture.
