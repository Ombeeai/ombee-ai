Comprehensive Guide to Vitamins and Minerals

Micronutrients are essential for bodily function but must be derived from food as the body cannot produce them all.

Key Essential Vitamins:
- Vitamin A: Crucial for vision and immune function. Sources: Carrots, sweet potatoes, spinach.
- Vitamin B Complex (B6, B12, Folate): Vital for energy production, brain function, and DNA synthesis. Sources: Meat, poultry, fish, leafy greens, legumes.
- Vitamin C: A powerful antioxidant that aids collagen production and iron absorption. Sources: Citrus fruits, bell peppers, strawberries.
- Vitamin D: Supports bone health and immune defense. Sources: Sunlight, fatty fish, fortified dairy.
- Vitamin E: Protects cells from damage (antioxidant). Sources: Nuts, seeds, vegetable oils.

Key Essential Minerals:
- Calcium: Necessary for bone structure and muscle contraction. Sources: Dairy, leafy greens, fortified plant milks.
- Iron: Essential for transporting oxygen in the blood. Sources: Red meat, beans, spinach (pair with Vitamin C for absorption).
- Magnesium: Supports muscle and nerve function, blood sugar control, and blood pressure. Sources: Nuts, seeds, whole grains, leafy greens.
- Potassium: Regulates fluid balance and heart contractions. Sources: Bananas, potatoes, avocados.
- Zinc: Supports immune system and wound healing. Sources: Oysters, beef, pumpkin seeds.

Holistic Note: It is generally recommended to obtain nutrients from whole foods rather than supplements to benefit from the synergistic effects of food compounds.
