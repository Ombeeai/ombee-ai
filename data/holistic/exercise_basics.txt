Holistic Exercise Basics

A holistic approach to exercise emphasizes movement for longevity, mental clarity, and functional ability rather than just aesthetics.

Guidelines for Balanced Health:
1. Aerobic Activity: Aim for 150 minutes of moderate activity (brisk walking) or 75 minutes of vigorous activity per week to support heart and lung health.
2. Muscle Strengthening: Engage major muscle groups 2+ days a week. Muscle tissue is metabolically active and crucial for bone density, blood sugar regulation, and joint protection as you age.
3. Mind-Body Connection: Pay attention to how movement feels. Exhaustion or pain signals overtraining; energy and mood boosts signal effective dosing.
4. Habit Formation:
   - "Snack" on exercise: 10-minute bursts of movement count toward your daily total.
   - Pair activities: Listen to a podcast while walking or stretch while watching TV.
   - Focus on consistency over intensity: A daily walk is better than an erratic intense gym session.
