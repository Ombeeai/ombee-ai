Holistic Heart Health Guidelines

Heart health is best supported by anti-inflammatory dietary patterns like the Mediterranean or DASH diets, combined with stress reduction.

Dietary Pillars:
- Plant-Forward: Emphasize fruits, vegetables, nuts, legumes, and whole grains.
- Healthy Fats: Prioritize olive oil, avocados, and omega-3s (salmon, walnuts, flaxseeds) over saturated fats (butter, fatty meats).
- Low Sodium: High salt intake raises blood pressure. Flavor with herbs and spices instead.
- Fiber: Soluble fiber (oats, beans) helps lower "bad" LDL cholesterol.

Lifestyle Factors:
- Movement: Regular aerobic exercise strengthens the heart muscle.
- Stress Management: Chronic stress raises blood pressure and heart rate; practices like meditation or deep breathing are cardioprotective.
- Sleep: Poor sleep is linked to higher risks of hypertension and heart disease.
