Intermittent Fasting (IF): A Beginner's Guide

Intermittent fasting focuses on *when* you eat rather than *what* you eat, allowing the body periods of rest to repair cellular damage and improve metabolic health.

Common Methods:
1. 16:8 Method: Fast for 16 hours, eat during an 8-hour window (e.g., eat between 12:00 PM and 8:00 PM). This is the most popular and sustainable for beginners.
2. 5:2 Method: Eat normally for 5 days; restrict calories (500-600) on 2 non-consecutive days.
3. Circadian Fasting: Eating only during daylight hours to align with the body's natural rhythm.

Potential Benefits:
- Improved insulin sensitivity and blood sugar control.
- Cellular repair (autophagy) and reduced inflammation.
- Weight management through natural calorie restriction.

Holistic Caution:
IF is not for everyone. Pregnant women, individuals with diabetes (on medication), or those with a history of eating disorders should consult a doctor. Quality of food during the eating window still matters—prioritize whole, nutrient-dense foods.
