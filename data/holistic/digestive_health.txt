Holistic Digestive Health: The Brain-Gut Connection

Digestive health is not just about food; it is deeply connected to the brain and nervous system (the "Brain-Gut Axis").

Holistic Approaches:
1. Mind-Body Therapies: Stress activates the "fight or flight" response, which shuts down digestion. Techniques like diaphragmatic breathing, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and gut-directed hypnotherapy can alleviate symptoms of IBS and functional pain.
2. Nutrition:
   - Fiber: Essential for motility and microbiome health, but increase slowly to avoid gas.
   - Prebiotics & Probiotics: Prebiotics (garlic, onions, bananas) feed gut bacteria; Probiotics (yogurt, kimchi, sauerkraut) introduce healthy bacteria.
   - Hydration: Water is critical for preventing constipation and aiding nutrient absorption.
3. Eating Hygiene: Chew food thoroughly and eat in a relaxed state (not while driving or working) to optimize digestive enzyme production.
