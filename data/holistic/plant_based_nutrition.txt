Plant-Based Nutrition & The Microbiome

A plant-based diet prioritizes foods derived from plants, including vegetables, grains, nuts, seeds, legumes, and fruits, with few or no animal products.

Holistic Benefits:
1. Microbiome Health: Fiber from plants acts as "fertilizer" for good gut bacteria. A diverse microbiome supports the immune system (80% of which resides in the gut) and even lung health.
2. Inflammation Reduction: Plant foods are high in antioxidants and phytonutrients that lower systemic inflammation, a root cause of chronic disease.
3. Disease Prevention: Studies link plant-forward diets to lower risks of heart disease, Type 2 diabetes, and severe outcomes from viral infections like COVID-19.

Getting Started:
- It doesn't have to be "all or nothing." Start by filling 2/3 of your plate with plants.
- Focus on variety ("eating the rainbow") to ensure a wide range of vitamins and minerals.
- Ensure adequate protein through beans, lentils, tofu, and nuts.
