Holistic Strategies for Weight Management

Sustainable weight management focuses on long-term lifestyle changes and environmental design rather than temporary dieting.

Strategic Changes:
1. Environment Design: Make healthy choices the easy choices. Keep fruits/veggies visible and hide or remove processed snacks.
2. Portion Awareness: Use smaller plates to adjust visual perception of fullness. Learn to estimate serving sizes (e.g., a portion of meat = deck of cards).
3. Caloric Balance: A balanced, hypocaloric diet (reducing intake by 500-1000 kcal/day) is standard, but quality matters. Focus on nutrient density (volume of food) so you feel full despite fewer calories.
4. Mindful Eating: Slow down. It takes 20 minutes for the brain to register fullness. eliminating distractions (TV, phones) during meals prevents overeating.
5. Sleep & Stress: Lack of sleep and high stress increase hunger hormones (ghrelin) and cravings for high-sugar/fat foods.
