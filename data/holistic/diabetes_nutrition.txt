Holistic Nutrition for Diabetes Management

Managing diabetes holistically involves stabilizing blood sugar through balanced, whole-food choices rather than deprivation.

Key Principles:
1. Complex Carbohydrates: Focus on whole grains, legumes, and vegetables. These digest slower than refined sugars, preventing blood glucose spikes.
2. The "Plate Method":
   - 1/2 Plate: Non-starchy vegetables (spinach, broccoli, carrots).
   - 1/4 Plate: Lean protein (chicken, fish, tofu, beans).
   - 1/4 Plate: Complex carbohydrate (brown rice, quinoa, sweet potato).
   - Add a small amount of healthy fat (avocado, nuts).
3. Fiber is Key: High-fiber foods slow sugar absorption. Aim for whole fruits instead of juices.
4. Consistent Timing: Eating at regular intervals helps the body regulate insulin levels more effectively.

Foods to Limit:
- Saturated fats (high-fat dairy, red meat) which can increase heart disease risk (a common comorbidity).
- Processed snacks and sugary beverages.
